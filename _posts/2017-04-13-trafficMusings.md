##Musings on traffic from my morning commute

Do you know what the new definition of "eternal" is? Four self driving cars at a four way stop.

Every morning I drive into San Francisco from Oakland and cross the Bay Bridge. Most mornings, I'm lucky enough to drive with two other passengers, unlocking the coveted HOV lane where there is never any traffic. However, on the off days that I can't muster a crew of three, I must take the normal path through the toll plaza. 

For those that are unfamiliar with the toll plaza I encounter: it is four lanes on an "on ramp" that merges into a larger throughway right before hitting a toll plaza. Unfortunately, the distance between the merger area and the toll plaza is far too small, so drivers that approach the toll plaza on this four lane ramp generally tend to use the corresponding four toll booths.

The red squiggly line represents the glorious HOV lane while the top right of the screen shows the four lane on ramp that I approach from.

This picture was taken during a time where traffic is light, but normally, all the lanes are backed up quite a ways and metering lights are enabled just past the toll booth. On any given morning, I notice a peculiarity when I drive on the four lane on ramp. If I rank traffic on a scale of 1 to 10 - 10 being an extremely long wait with many cars ahead, and 1 as no traffic, these four lanes would look something like:

* Right most lane: 10
* Second from the right lane: 9
* Third from the right lane: 5
* Fourth from the right lane (left most): 2

Note, only the right lane is FastPass-only while the other three are all Cash/FastPass. Also - there are no Cash-only lanes on the bridge.

As I have come to discover - the left most lane is hardly ever clogged because that is the lane "savvy" drivers take before cutting three lanes back to the right to get into the FastPass-only lane. Essentially, people that are honest enough to wait in the right most lane from the beginning get the worst of it and wait the longest. Everyone else is playing the classic game of chicken - the earlier you cut in, the longer you wait. 

It is unfortunate that everyone starts off their day debating the question: What's worse - waiting 30 minutes or getting honked at as you aggressively cut 3 lanes in rapid succession?
