## Startup

Ideas are cheap; it all comes down to execution. In order to execute well, you need to have the right team. However, with team comes culture - an aspect that is as important as anything else especially during the early stages of a company; culture can make or break a company. Therefore, I was adamant on making sure that not only each team member was carefully screened, but that our first week set forth the proper culture for our team. 

### Culture 

So - what is good culture? In my mind, culture defines how a team operates and how team members interact with each other. For us, I tried to lay down a few overarching ideas, all of which were compiled through previous experiences at both successful and not as successful teams I have worked on. 

#### Teamwork

This trait goes without saying. If a team cannot work together, it will fall apart, especially in these early stages where roles are not clearly defined and everyone needs to contribute to keep the company moving forward. One way that I try to screen for this is to have potential candidates chat with all of our team members before we commit to a hiring decision. This allows different team members to form different opinions and to see if the candidate would fit well. 

#### Transparency

One of the great learnings from Udacity was the sheer amount of transparency at the organization. Notably, top down - financials, goals, numbers - these were all proliferated throughout the organization (internally). This created a sense of bonding, but also common mission to help improve company-wide numbers. It helped people focus on goals, and be able to set personal KRs that lined up directly with company-level goals. Of course, in a small 5 person startup, everyone knows everything, but I hope to keep the same level of transparency as we scale. 

#### Ambitious

This trait is something that Silicon Valley embodies (or at least, used to), and requires a change in mindset to fully grasp here in Europe. Ambition is not lacking, but the "grit" and "grind" are what need to be surfaced. It is not a measure of "facetime," or hours in the office. Instead, it is about setting ambitious goals, and the "whatever it takes" mentality to get them done. It is one of the key defining features of a startup - and the hardest to screen for when hiring here. 

### Day One

As Jeff Bezos has repeatedly proffered: It is always Day One. I look forward to tomorrow.
