## Setting Goals

Goals are tangible. Goals serve as the benchmark for our performance. Goals should be ambitious.

We did not meet our goals for our first week. Instead, we learned. A lot. 

A lot of what we need to accomplish right now is B2B sales, and B2B sales takes time. How much time? Well - more than a week :)

What are our goals for next week? Well, not all that different, but instead of focusing on the weekly goal, we are going to set it on a monthly goal (just with a weekly average). 

### Failing quickly, constantly innovating

One realization early on was that our business (from the sales side) is not all that different than when Groupon first started out - trying to entertain merchants and store owners to adopt their product. While sales is never easy - there is a lot that we can learn from - some of that will work for us, and some won't. For the ones that won't (we've seen a couple already), be sure to fail quickly and move on. Let's see how next week goes!

## Denmark

Now two weeks into Denmark (though it feels much longer), I feel obliged to post a few photos and updates around how we're doing and fitting in. So far it has been a blast. We've been a couple times to a fantastic boardgame cafe (the Bastard Cafe), seen the viking museum, and walked through numerous neighborhoods (Frederiksberg, City Center, etc.). I've started feeling quite like a local: got my metro card (similar to our Clipper card), ridden bikes to work in the city, and cook dinner with my roommates most nights of the week! 

A few photos for those interested (and since I'm quite absent on the usual channels of social media):
