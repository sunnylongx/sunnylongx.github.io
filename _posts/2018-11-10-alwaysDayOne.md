## Startup Day 1

The first day you start a company, it is truly "Day 1". We held a brainstorm session and listed out over twenty cool features that we would love to build. Now let's build them! There is a level of unparallel enthusiasm and camaraderie in the first day of "work". Excitement and imaginations allow us to leave the deadweight of reality just a little, and give ourselves a glimpse of what could be...

## Startup Day 2 and beyond

Once the initial euphoria dies down, and the routine of daily work starts to settle in, everyone slowly sinks in to "heads down" mode. In other words, daily startup challenges pop up; putting out fires and attending to immediate issues takes the place of bigger picture thinking. This inevitably happens as a startup slowly grows up and morphs into a real company. So how can we continue the initial momentum and excitement? 

### Retrospection and Goals

In most of the startups that I've had the chance to take part in, sometimes months would pass by before we would have a chance to take a breath and lift our head out of "heads down" mode. In my mind, the idea of taking more of these breaths allows for re-alignment of teams, especially during the early phases of a company. 

Retrospection allows us the time to celebrate past victories, and how far we have come; a proverbial pat on the back for a job well done. Afterwards, it is the perfect opportunity to reaffirm the mission of the company while re-iterating (or resetting) goals and expectations for the next few weeks. Again, this mechanism is to make sure that the big picture is clear for everyone, and doesn't get lost in the day to day hustle and bustle. 

## Back to day 1

We are nearly two months in to our journey. We have done so much, but that has lead to so much more potential. We should retrospect, celebrate, and re-calibrate. Tomorrow is day 1.
