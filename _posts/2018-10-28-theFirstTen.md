## The First Ten

If you are a SaaS business, unless you are the first of your kind, you will most likely already have competition. In our case, we have two very large incumbents (20+ years) and a handful of small companies like ours. Therefore, once you have developed a product, your first ten customers will be **the most important**. 

In the majority of SaaS startups - your product won't be perfect, in fact, far from it. These first ten customers will be your innovation partners. They will tell you what features are key, and which are not. They will be your biggest advocates (anc critics). Without them, your product will fail.

Once you land your first 10 customers, you will need to cater to their every beck and call - features, troubleshooting, everything. Every piece of feedback is constructive, and should prompt a reaction. Hopefully that reaction is: "Yes, we're working on it." 

### Why you?

For any product, there must be a good reason to use it. For any product with competitors, there must be a **better** reason to use yours. Depending on how "life or death" your product is, this reason could range from pricing (for commoditized products) to a whole slew of features that make you stand out. 

However, even with a slew of features that may be better than the competition, it is also extremely important to avoide the self-deluding rationalization camp where the assumption that your better feature set will easily dethrone entrenched competitors. Another way of saying this: "If you build it, they will come." For the highly technical groupthinkers in the Bay Area, this is a dangerous pitfall that should be avoided at all costs. 

### Stickiness

Though we are very early on in our journey, we still think about long term product development and how we can chart a path to not only acquire customers, but **keep** existing customers. The element of stickiness comes in - how difficult will it be to switch off of your platform and features to a different one? A key element of successful SaaS products is this stickiness. In other words - just providing one feature is not enough. We need to build around that feature and slowly become so entrenched in the business of our customers that swapping us out simply is not an option! 

Of course, we are not there yet - we still need to confirm our first 10. But we always need to keep the big picture in mind :)
