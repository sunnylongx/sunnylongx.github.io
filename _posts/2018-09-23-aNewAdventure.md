## Udacity

It has been just over a year since I started my position at Udacity. It is truly bittersweet to say goodbye to my Udacifam. Udacity has been one of the best tech companies I have had the privilege of working, and without a doubt a company with the most audacious and inspiring mission statements: Democratize Education. 


### Next

So, what's next? I will try to revitalize my blog, and write down my thoughts as much as I can. New adventures are best chronicled as they happen! This will be a mix of personal and professional.

#### Adventure

So - what's next?

I am returning to startup world - specifically teaming up with two good friends and working on a new project. As if that is not in itself enough of an adventure, we will be starting this project on international soil - Denmark!
