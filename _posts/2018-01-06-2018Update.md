## 2018, new year, new updates

It has been a short week since the last post, so this will be a quick one. Updates on my 2018 goals.

My average time using the phone has fluctuated from 1 hour to 3 hours per day. However, that does include the 2 hours (sometimes up to 3.5 hours) that I keep Google Maps on. I estimate I use my phone around 90 minutes a day, which is not as bad as I originally feared, but still something to improve upon. 

On the learning front, I've started the Isaacson biography of Steve Jobs - quite interesting so far.

TV/video watching hasn't changed much - this is one goal I need to set stricter limits around. 

One last thought - Black Mirror season 4 was fantastic!
