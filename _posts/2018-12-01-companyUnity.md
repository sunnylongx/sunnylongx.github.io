## Company Unity

I have mentioned team importance and cohesion of team members before. However, it is not every day that the importance of cohesion comes into play. Specific details aside, I would like to put down a few points which I think are of utmost importance. 

### Leadership

As a leader, it is your job (and only yours) to enable others to perform to their best. Poor leadership and guidance often leads to confusion and an uninspiring work environment. To be clear, this enablement reflects itself in many different ways. One day it could be shown in leading the company direction through projects and setting goals. Another day it could be in the form of admitting a mistake and reversing course. Regardless the shape or form this takes, it is of utmost importance to make sure your employees and fellow team are best set up to succeed. 

### Consideration

We are all human. Leaders (especially) should never lose focus of this. Regardless of success or failure, leaders need to be considerate and understanding of team mates. Business and success of the company must never completely overlap the human side of work. 

### Transparency

Back to this...there are companies that are very opaque internally, and that can work. But, for companies that aspire to be transparent (which I believe is an important ingredient to success), companies should commit to it to the fullest. Every company has skeletons - and despite the best "transparent" attempts as disguising or sweeping them under the rug, they will come out some day. It is usually better to face them in the right lens and at the right time. 

## Our progress

We're now back to our home countries. Luckily, we have a set agenda on what we would like to do for the next few weeks - so we'll be busy!
