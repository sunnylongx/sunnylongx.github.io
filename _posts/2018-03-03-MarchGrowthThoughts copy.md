## March

Sticking to a habit and routine (new resolutions) is hard. Hence the high number of gym signups in January, but the massive decline as the months go on. I realized I have missed a couple weeks of blog posts, apologies. Hopefully today's post will get me back on track.

I want to get a few thoughts onto the proverbial paper. 

### Growth

When building a company there are a few stages. First, there's product-market fit. Create MVPs, iterate quickly, establish a fit with your audience. Once you have that signal, then comes the growth stage. Growth is hard. Specifically, scalable and economical growth is hard. Even with massive amounts of venture capital to fuel the fire, it is hard to grow. 

#### Marketing

Growth for B2C companies will always be intertwined with marketing. Deploying large amounts of cash to cross channel marketing (social media, print, radio, tv, etc.) helps companies grow, but if you spend more money than you get back - it is not sustainable. And yet, so many companies kick that sustainability question down the road. 

The chicken and egg: in order to discover scalable growth mediums, you need to spend money. Therein lies the problem - not everyone can break into sustainable spending, burning through cash. 

#### Local maxima

With heavy investments of growth, we periodically can see times of "scalable growth" - where we might find a good pocket of audiences that clicks with our product, or we introduce a new product that experiences a nice bump. These false signals often can derail a company for months. When we rest on our laurels with these local maxima of scalable growth - we put resources into items that don't contribute to ultimate success. We might put money to work on side projects, skunkworks, etc. But when we reach the inevitable end of scalability (when cost per acquisition starts creeping back up), we are back at square one, or worse, we've put money into non-essential projects and not into proving out sustainable growth avenues. Google X wasn't established on day 1. 

With all that said about growth, we can continue to acknowledge that startups are hard. Every step of the process, even with solid ideas and execution, there is constantly the threat of failure. Hats off to those entrepreneurs!

### Commuting

In other news - Uber has been giving me 40% off rides for the past 2 weeks. Not sure what their algorithm has determined, but keep it coming :)
