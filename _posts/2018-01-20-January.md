## January

Back from snow-less Tahoe (only to receive the news that they are getting 10 inches this weekend, haha). Thank goodness for snow-making and larger resorts!

Other updates - still working through the Steve Jobs book - very interesting gaining insight into one of the most charismatic leaders of our time. Hoping to finish the book by the end of January (though the remaining 70% is probably a bit too much - we'll see) Next week, taking a quick vacation with Nicole to Copenhagen! Our first time there - looking forward to exploring the great food options in that city. Perhaps the 15 hour flight (via WOW) will let me finish the book.

### Bitcoin ATM
Finally managed to dust this off (literally as it has been sitting in our closet for quite a while). Updates to the tablet are done. I need to set up the backend and voila! Looking forward to getting this out in the wild.

### Other miscellaneous

Traffic was...terrible this week into SF. See previous posts on my theory on traffic.
