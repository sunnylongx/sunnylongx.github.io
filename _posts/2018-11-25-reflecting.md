## Recap

9 weeks goes by fast. Borrowing this from Steve Jobs: “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.”

I was joking with a colleague yesterday, "Vacation's ending." He looked at me, and said, "that wasn't a vacation" to which I responded, "but it was fun." Indeed, the past two months was not a vacation - there was no relaxation. However, it was probably the most fun I've had working. 

So, what have we done in 9 weeks?

- Registered and incorporated a company in Denmark
- Grown the team by 50%
- Developed and released an iOS app and a webapp (with an Android app on the way)
- Signed up a few stores to be test partners for launch
- Networked. A. Lot. 

## What is next?

We took a leap of faith, come to Denmark for 9 weeks. No safety nets. No guarantees. With a stroke of luck, we started something promising. It seems like our experiment panned out. So for now, regroup (albeit back at home for the rest of the year). Then come out full force in 2019. Get ready.
