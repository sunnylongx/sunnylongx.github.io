## Travel

I missed a weekly blog update. It was bound to happen, but half the battle is to make sure to stem that slip as soon as possible, hence, this post. I spent the last week traveling through with Nicole to Denmark and then solo on to Zurich. I wanted to detail a few highlights and remarks here.

### Castles, castles, castles

There are a lot of castles in Denmark. We went to a few (Frederiksborg Castle, Kronborg Castle a.k.a Hamlet's castle, Christiansborg Palace). For those that haven't truly seen a castle (think large stone structures, 50+ rooms, amazing intricate carvings), I highly encourage visiting these (especially Frederiksborg). 

I won't dig too dive too deeply, but one overarching thought - seeing how royalty lived hundreds of years ago, when status might have been measured by the number of rooms in your estate - shows how far we've come. Sure, when we look around smart devices are ubiquitous, portable electronics, scale and technological advancements. It serves as a reminder to continue to press forward and effect the next wave of transitions and evolution. 

One cute innovation that I need to bring up was the "chair lift" in one of the rooms - a chair hoisted by rope that could descend into the room right below it. Amazing.


### Culture

Danish (and by extension to a certain extent, European) culture is day and night contrasted with American culture. 

Trust: There is almost a calming overlay of trust across the city in Copenhagen. Doors sometimes unlocked, bikes unlocked, bags left unattended at cafes for a quick bathroom trip. 

Punctuality: Sitting at a communal table eating breakfast one morning, I overheard the Danish gentleman next to me declare to his friend, "I have never been late to a meeting." This matches my personal experience - the few meetings that I had, tardiness was never a factor. 

Friendliness: Have a question? Just ask. Not only do all Danes have nearly perfect English, they are extremely friendly and helpful. There are no stupid questions - you might get a small smile at a silly question, but it never cuts deeper than the cosmetic twitch of the mouth.

## Zurich

A very quick detour in Zurich, meeting up with a friend for two days. What can I say - truly a financial capital (UBS, ubiquitous). On the hunt for a traditional swiss meal led my friend and me to cheese fondue. Oh boy...melted boiling cheese over a fire, dipping bread. Be warned, anyone less than a true cheese aficionado, best stick to the other items on the menu. 

Oh...Switzerland is very expensive - perhaps most poignantly captured by the inhabitant that rents the Presidential Suite (at our Renaissance) at list price for weeks at a time. 


## Product Ruminations

Not only did I miss an update last week, but I also was not able to finish the Steve Jobs book before the end of January, I ended up finishing it a few days late into February. I tremendously enjoyed reading the book - definitely recommended and easily a page turner. 

On a deeper level, it was amazing to glance into the life and obsessiveness that Jobs had over his products. The idea of an end-to-end product for the everyday person resonates with me on many levels. The fixation on the end-user is something I would like to emulate in the upcoming products I design and create. Without the visionary side of Steve, we can only research and iterate as fast as possible to reach the same conclusion he could see steps ahead. But perhaps along the way, we can discover different paths, and draw different conclusions. 

My feedback: his genious and vision often led to near-perfect products, but there are many different flavors of perfection.
