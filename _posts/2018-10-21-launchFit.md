## Product Market Fit

For any startup, the idea of a product-market fit is what dreams are made of. But how do we go from 0 to a product that fits into a market, and why wasn't it there before? 

For our purposes here, let's vaguely clock "fit" at a product that users will actually use, sometimes measured as monthly active users (MAUs) or even daily active users (DAUs). In my mind, the majority of products that achieve the elusive "fit" are one of two categories:

* It is "life or death" if we don't have it
* It integrates **so** easily into our daily routines, that your habit changes

### A Life or Death Product

The first reason (and the driver of most successful products) is introducing a product that a person cannot live without (figuratively). In a more general sense, *it helps solve a large problem that users had in a creative or more efficient way*. 

An example is Amazon AWS. For the longest time, starting any web-based company would require hardware and high costs. Then came Amazon and cloud computing, which solved an enormous hurdle. 

For these types of products, long term success will be determined by how big of a problem you solved as well as the how difficult it is for competitors to reproduce your solution (e.g. Google Cloud). 

### A habit-changing product

The second type of product is one that may not be revolutionary, but is so simple and easy to use that it creates a change in user behavior. Usually these products also help solve a problem users had, but are not "life or death" problems. 

An example here is Uber, Lyft, etc. These ride-sharing companies, while convenient, are not solving crucial transportation problems - we managed to get from point A to point B just fine before they came along. However, I would argue that their sheer simplicty (and the billions of marketing dollrs) helped catapault them to success, and are now lodged not only into our habits, but even our vernacular: "Oh I'll just Uber home." 

## Our product's fit

While still very early days for us, we are trying to carve out our little bit of product-market fit. Where can we improve the current processes for our customers, and more importantly - how can we be sticky? Stay tuned - we will see in a couple weeks time.
