##Brinksmanship in China: the costly battle for ride-sharing

As Uber looks to proliferate its services across the globe, its greatest hurdle has been winning over China. It’s locked in a battle with Didi Chuxing, the homegrown taxi-hailing app. With a bill of $1B per year, it truly is an expensive battle — or is it a smart investment?

Let’s make the assumption that the ride-sharing market has been completely commoditized — both drivers and riders will use any service as long as the benefit is greater (in this case, the price). To compete for drivers and riders alike, both companies need to offer promotions, hence the hefty bill. For argument’s sake, let’s say that Uber currently controls around 30% of the market, and Didi the other 70%. And given our perfectly comoditized market, to winover customers (drivers and riders) a company needs to offer a promotion, let’s say, $1 off a ride (or $1 extra to drivers per ride).

In our scenario, for the market to remain a 30/70 divide, for every $1 that Uber spends on promotions, Didi needs to spend $2.33 (70 divided by 30). If they didn’t then Uber would increase its market share in China — definitely not what Didi wants.

So what does this mean? Well — every year Uber is paying a very large sum of money to compete, but Didi is paying more, multiples more — even just to retain the status quo for market share, let alone try to grow market share.

What’s going to happen?

As the saying goes, “Money doesn’t grow on trees” — and companies can’t raise money (and burn unprofitably) forever. There are a few scenarios that could play out:

1. Both companies keep spending until one runs out of money, the solvent company wins.
2. The companies agree on a truce (profit-sharing agreement).
3. Uber backs out of China completely.

Option 3, as it currently stands, would be a loss for Uber — not an option right now.

Option 2, though this sounds like it could be a win-win for both parties, it is the most complicated endgame to reach. Even if a profit-sharing agreement could be reached (e.g. Uber gets 20% of all Didi’s China revenue, and Didi gets 10% of revenue from Uber’s non-China revenue), such an agreement could prove tricky to incentivize either party to push hard for expansion to new areas (think communism).

Option 1, if the status quo continues, this could well play out. But is it a victory for either company? For Didi — it could be seen as a pyrrhic victory. For Uber, it could be a significant battle loss, but propel them towards victory of the global war. This path buys them time to truly figure out how to retain and grow market share sustainably in a commoditized market — perhaps it’s a loyalty program (frequent flier miles, Starbucks rewards, etc.), perhaps it’s driver-less cars? Until they figure out the best solution, they’re happy to bide their time.

If Didi truly wants to push Uber out of China, it is spending its money in a very inefficient manner — why spend multiples of what Uber spends in China? Instead, why not take the battle to where a dollar spend goes much further? As a hypothetical (still in our commoditized market regime), let’s say Didi were to quietly launch their service in New York or Madrid. This would force Uber to fight on multiple fronts — a very costly war (remember, in all other countries Uber has majority share, and thus would need to spend more to keep it vs. Didi). Perhaps even the threat of this global expansion by Didi would expedite Uber’s backing out of China.

It will be interesting to see how this plays out — but Didi’s vehement denial of global expansion is playing right into Uber’s grand plan.
