A discussion today got me thinking about a project from a while back (January of 2012 to be exact) - a precursor to [Just Baguette]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-11-01-JustBaguette %}). Snapshop was an idea born out of cold Boston winter treks to the supermarket while at MIT. While we had dorm food, many others like myself enjoyed the occasional self-cooked meal, but that meant braving the freezing 2-mile round trip to Star Market. Living in a dorm of 300 people, I found myself making trips alongside many others every week to gather basic ingredients as well as other dorm room staples including milk, cereal, and ramen. It got me thinking - why suffer individually? If we could get a delivery to the dorm, no one needed to go out - thus Snapshop, a grocery ordering aggregator (fulfillment through Peapod) was born.

With every good idea - logo first:

We dreamed that this would be a cure for urban grocery shopping - entire apartment buildings could be serviced by weekly deliveries. We even created a hype/promo video - a first for me. Please watch with the audio on (self-narrated too)

It was a neat concept and idea - logistically it would have been difficult, especially on the delivery level. Everyone needed to be home; someone needed to help parse out different deliveries from others...a nightmare. We decided to shut it down after a few months, but was definitely a cool experience. We built an iOS app and a webapp - one that rivaled the design of other grocery on demand apps back in the day (which was really not setting a high bar - think iPhone 4 with large blocky buttons)!

Things learned:
* Product and Efficiencies
* Marketing Videos
