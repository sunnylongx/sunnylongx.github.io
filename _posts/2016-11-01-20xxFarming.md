I have been thinking about what my next project should be for some time. Apps like Uber, Airbnb, etc. are cool, but are not solving the next big problem. Companies like SpaceX, Tesla, Amazon are solving big problems. Be like them.

Today, I am starting on my next big project (pseudo-startup) - building a better indoor farm to maximize efficiency. I am defining efficiency from both a cost and output perspective - biggest bang for your buck.

From reading Professor Toyoki Kozai's overview on the commercial indoor growing operations, the two largest costs (that make up >50% of total spend) are lighting (electricity) and human overhead. I'm going to work on a two-prong approach. For the electricity usage, I will work towards greater efficiency in system design (the physical infrastructure)
, better data analysis (for feedback systems), and more efficient lighting (LEDs/spectrum customization). For human overhead - robotic automation will slowly help relieve the burden on manual labor (planting, harvesting, etc.)

I'll be starting with MIT's OpenAg framework, but building on top of that. I would like to build out a modular prototype that allows for large-scale automated A/B testing and dynamic updating of variables.
