## Here's to 2018

And what a Year 2018 has been... A few of the highlights:

- Took a major leap of faith to start a new company, in a foreign country
- Traveled to said country 4 times (including one stay of over two months)
- Grew our team to six full time folks
- And so much more...

For me, 2018 was a year of consolidation, laying down groundwork, and planning for 2019. And so here we go...

## What is in store for 2019

I'd like to document this separately for personal and business, thought there will definitely be overlaps. I'll defer Business goals for a later post.

### 2019 Personal

Similar to last year, I'd like to start out with a few goals that I would like to try to keep to as much as possible this year (even more so than last year, haha).

- Read at least one book and one scientific article (technical) every month
- Exercise 3x a week
- Write at least 1x a week
- Disconnect more, starting with the phone

Goals 1 through 3 are carried over from previous years, and very straightforward. Goal number 4 is new, and is left vague on purpose. There have been countless articles documenting how addicted to screens humanity is. More often than not, this addiction effects detrimental consequences: less interaction with other humans, less ability to focus, etc. For 2019, I would like to actively put my phone and computer down more. Half of this effort has to do with work-life balance. When "not at work", truly be off work (at least only be reactive and not proactive in checking in). The other half has to do with changing habit and "default" modes of thinking. Today, if there is nothing to do, we automatically resolve to checking our phones to keep busy, whether that be checking social media or the news. I am as guilty as any one else on this - just looking at my Apple Screen Time report shows how much is sunk into reading news apps. Therefore, I will actively try to change this default behavior of lifting my phone. 

I think I'll put this here for now - by no means does this even begin to encapsulate all the behaviors/mindsets that I would like to change. But this is a start :)
